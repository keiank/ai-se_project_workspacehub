# Project Overview
Project Workspace Hub is a full-stack project and task tracker that uses Typescript and the MERN (with Vite) stack to implement a web app that allows companies to manage their work. It allows multi-tenant organizations, role-based access, projects, tasks, bookings, and per-organization feature flags. It is run as an npm workspaces (`client/` and `server/`) monorepo.

## Stack

- Frontend: React + React Router + Vite + TypeScript + Axios.
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Mongoose (MongoDB) + JWT auth (`requireAuth` middleware)
- Tooling: ESLint 9 (flat config) + Prettier across both workspaces; Vitest for client unit tests

## Folder structure
- client/ contains front-end code
- server/ contains back-end code that follows the MVC pattern.
- **/types/ holds Typescript types used in the folder 2 levels up from itself.
- `server/src/models/`: Mongoose schemas. Types are derived from `InferSchemaType<typeof schema> & { _id: Types.ObjectId }` - never hand-write a matching interface.
- register models using the document as a type parameter `model<XDocument>("X", xSchema)`. For example:
  - `export const Task = model<TaskDocument>("Task", taskSchema);`
- `server/src/routes/` -> `server/src/controllers/` -> `server/src/services/`: the three backend layers. Routes wire up middleware and call `asyncHandler(controller)`; controllers extract request data, call a service, and respond with `sendSuccess(res, data)`; services hold business logic, database calls, and permission checks.
- `server/src/services/permissionService.ts`: every `canManage*` authorization check lives here, not in individual services or controllers.
- `client/src/types/models.ts`: frontend model and payload types. Update payloads are `Partial<CreatePayload>`, derived from the narrower create payload - never `Partial` of the full model.
- `client/src/services/*Service.ts`: one file per resource, each function wrapped in `unwrapResponse`.
- `client/src/pages/`, `client/src/components/`: pages own data loading and state; components receive data as props.


## Conventions

- Every document is scoped to an `organizationId`; new models and queries must respect that scoping.
- Frontend permission checks (`client/src/utils/permissions.ts`) mirror backend rules for UX only - the backend check is the real boundary and
  must exist independently.
- Don't add a database field or endpoint for something the frontend can derive from data it already has.

## Build, test, and validate

- `npm run dev:server` / `npm run dev:client`: start the two dev servers, in separate terminals.
- `npm run seed`: reseed demo data (`owner@workspacehub.dev`,
  `admin@workspacehub.dev`, `member@workspacehub.dev`; password
  `Password123!`).
- `npm run typecheck`: type-check both workspaces (`--workspace client` or `--workspace server` to scope it).
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format:check`: run across the whole repo, not per-workspace.

## Where to look first

- `server/src/app.ts`: middleware and route mounting.
- `server/src/routes/taskRoutes.ts` + `taskController.ts` + `taskService.ts`:
  a complete reference slice for the 3-layer pattern.
- `client/src/pages/TasksPage.tsx`: data loading, Tailwind conventions, and
  permission-gated UI, all in one file.

## Conditional constraints

For frontend work:

- Do NOT touch anything on the backend unless explicitly asked.
- Do NOT change the shape of any existing types unless explicitly asked.
- UI states must follow this pattern:
  1. **Loading:** The initial request is still in progress.
  2. **Load error:** The initial request failed, so the page can't safely show the ready UI.
  3. **Empty success:** The request succeeded, but there are no items to show.
  4. **Ready success:** The request succeeded, and there are items to show.
  5. **Action error:** The page is already usable, but a later create, update, or delete action failed.

For mock/test data:

- Do NOT invent fields. Do NOT include backend-only fields like passwordHash.
- Always use `_id`, not `id`.
- Include all required fields.
- Use valid constrained values (like specific status strings).
- Relationship fields (like `projectId`) must point to the right kind of record.
- Date fields must use the serialized string format expected by the frontend.

For routes and controllers:
- All routes must be protected by the `requireAuth` middleware.
- All controller functions must be wrapped in `asyncHandler()` to automatically catch `Promise` rejections.
- Controllers must use `sendSuccess(res, data)` utility instead of calling `res.json()` directly.
